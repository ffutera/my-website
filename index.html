            <p>
                Hi, I'm Filip. I am currently entering my 4th year of my bachelor degree in computer science at the University of Edinburgh. I have also just completed an exchange year at the California Institute of Technology where I pursued courses in computer science and mathematics. Beyond computing, I have a strong interest in sports and fitness including volleyball and football. I also enjoy trying new things and continuously learning new skills. The below timeline showcases some of the significant events in my academic and professional career so far.
