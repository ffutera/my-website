            <p>
                Hi, I'm Filip. 
                I just finished my Masters degree in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh with an exchange year at the California Institute of Technology. 
                Beyond computing, I have a strong interest in sports and fitness including volleyball and football. I also enjoy continuously trying and learning new skills. The below timeline showcases some of the significant events in my academic and professional career so far.
